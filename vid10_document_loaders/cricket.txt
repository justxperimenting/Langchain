The Gentlemen’s Game

On fields of green where willows swing,
Eleven dream, eleven sing.
A leather ball, a wooden bat,
A bowler’s glare, a batter’s hat.

The summer sun, the roaring crowd,
A perfect cover drive so proud.
A spinner’s trick, a fielder’s dive,
In cricket’s grace, the game’s alive.

From village greens to stadium’s light,
They chase the day into the night.
A sport of poise, of heart and grit —
An endless tale — this game of cricket.
